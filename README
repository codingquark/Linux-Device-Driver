Added another example with memory_chrdev directory.
However, the example does NOT create nodes in /dev/ It has to be done manually.
And, don't try to write anything to the device files. It might show unexpected results. In my case, it hangs up the whole system.
Logically, this behavior is normal. Please refer to the source code to understand why.
